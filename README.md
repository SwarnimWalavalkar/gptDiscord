# Discord GPT

A GPT-3.5 Powered Discord Chatbot
Hello and welcome to the Read Me file for the ChatGPT Discord Bot. In this document, you will find all the necessary information on how to install, set up and use this bot.

Installation
First, you need to create a new Discord bot account and get the bot token. To do this, go to the Discord Developer Portal and follow the instructions to create a new bot account. Make sure to copy the bot token as you will need it later.

Next, clone the ChatGPT repository from GitHub to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ChatGPT.git
Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the root directory of the project and create a new file called .env. In this file, add the following line:
makefile
Copy code
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
Make sure to replace your_bot_token_here with the actual bot token that you copied in step 1.

Finally, install the required dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:
Copy code
npm install
Setting up the bot
To set up the bot, you need to create a new Discord server or use an existing one.

Once you have created your server, invite the bot by going to the Discord Developer Portal and copying the bot's Client ID. Then, go to the following URL (replace YOUR_CLIENT_ID with the actual Client ID):

bash
Copy code
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&scope=bot&permissions=2147483647
This will take you to a page where you can authorize the bot to join your server.

Once the bot is authorized, you can start using it in your server. Type !help in a channel to see a list of available commands.
Usage
The ChatGPT Discord Bot uses OpenAI's GPT-3 API to generate responses to messages. To use the bot, simply type !gpt3 followed by your message. For example:

csharp
Copy code
!gpt3 What is the meaning of life?
The bot will generate a response based on your message using the GPT-3 API.
